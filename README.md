Metal Bands by Nation
==============================

"Music is like a mirror, and it tells people a lot about who you are and what you care about, whether you like it or not. We love to say "you are what you stream," - Spotify

Metal music was developed in the late 1960s largely in the United Kingdom. It introduced a new form of the empathic beat with massive sounds, extended guitar solos, and extreme loudness. Not many people enjoy metal music due to the fear of its complexity. Nevertheless, research shows that metal music makes you calmer and helps heal aggression and stress.

INSPIRATION:

Music is something I consume every day. I enjoy listening to metal music and I am fascinated by exploring the unique features of the different metal bands in the universe. Listening to Heavy Metal helped me stay calm and purge negative emotions.

GOALS:

Given the data, I will use my knowledge to run an experiment to see if there is an increase in the number of fans for metal bands based on its country. I intend to use statistical inference testing in deriving sufficient results for the experiment.

Problem Statement:

The fanbase for metal music has been increasing rapidly for over a decade but;

Is there any indication of the increase in fans for metal music according to its country of origin?
What is the relationship between the bands and fans based on their country of origin?
Are more bands being originated in the United States or Sweden?
